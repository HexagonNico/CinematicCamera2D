## Cinematic camera node for 2D scenes.
## Uses a VirtualCamera2D to create transitions between cameras.


## The node that this camera is supposed to follow.
## The camera's global position will be set to this node's global position every frame.

## The current virtual camera node. A scene may have several virtual cameras, but only needs one
## cinematic camera. Update this value to transition between different cameras.
@export var virtual_camera: VirtualCamera2D = null
## The speed at which the transitions take place. Used by zoom and offset.
